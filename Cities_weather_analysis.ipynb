    "## Importance of Weather Data\n",
    "Weather data plays a crucial role in various fields such as `agriculture`, `transportation`, `energy`, and `tourism`. Farmers rely on weather forecasts to plan planting and harvesting schedules. Airlines and shipping companies use weather data to optimize routes and ensure passenger safety. Energy companies use weather forecasts to predict demand and manage resources efficiently. Additionally, weather data is essential for tourism, as travelers often base their destination choices and activities on current and forecasted weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Overall, **accurate** and **reliable** weather data is vital for making informed decisions and mitigating risks in various industries and everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "My friend, a travel agent, often faces challenges when presenting travel destinations to clients. One common question from clients is about the **weather conditions** of their desired destinations. To address this, my friend asked me to collect data on the **top 100 tourist destination cities worldwide** for `April 28th, 2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will help him provide better presentations to his clients by offering **detailed insights** into the weather conditions of these cities on that specific date. With this information readily available, my friend can enhance his client consultations and ensure that travelers have a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience during their trips.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction of Dataset\n",
    "This dataset provides **temperature data** for the top 100 cities worldwide as of `April 28th, 2024`. It consists of seven columns, each offering specific information to understand the weather conditions in different cities. The dataset includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `City`\n",
    "The name of the city in English language. This column provides the official or commonly used name of each city. City names are essential for identifying the geographical location associated with the weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `Temperature (°C)`\n",
    "The temperature recorded for each city on `April 28th, 2024`. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (`°C`) and represents the average atmospheric temperature at the specified location on the given date. It is an essential parameter in weather analysis, indicating the warmth or coldness of the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `Wind Speed (m/s)`\n",
    "The average wind speed measured at each location in `meters per second (m/s)`. Wind speed is a measure of the movement of air molecules and is an important factor in weather prediction and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `Latitude (°)`\n",
    "The latitude coordinates of each city, expressed in degrees. Latitude measures the north-south position of a location on the Earth's surface relative to the equator. Positive values represent locations in the northern hemisphere, while negative values represent locations in the southern hemisphere. Latitude ranges from `-90°` (South Pole) to `+90°` (North Pole), with `0°` at the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `Longitude (°)`\n",
    "The longitude coordinates of each city, expressed in degrees. Longitude measures the east-west position of a location on the Earth's surface relative to the Prime Meridian. Positive values represent locations east of the Prime Meridian, while negative values represent locations west of it. Longitude ranges from `-180°` (West) to `+180°` (East), with `0°` at the Prime Meridian.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `Description`\n",
    "This column provides details about the prevailing weather conditions in each city on `April 28th, 2024`. It includes descriptions such as `clear sky`, `scattered clouds`, `broken clouds`, `overcast clouds`, and `few clouds`, indicating the level of cloud cover and sky visibility at the time of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. `Country`\n",
    "This column contains the name of the country to which each city belongs. It provides information about the city with its respective country.\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",

    "   - Standard Python `str` type, used to store textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Storage**:\n",
    "   - Each unique string is stored as is.\n",
    "   - Memory usage can be higher, especially with a large number of unique strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operations**:\n",
    "   - Supports all standard string operations and methods.\n",
    "   - Slower for operations involving large datasets with many unique strings, due to the lack of optimization for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Case**:\n",
    "   - Ideal for columns with a small number of unique strings or when the exact text value is important.\n",

    "   - Represents a fixed number of possible values (categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Storage**:\n",
    "   - Internally stores data as integer codes and a separate array of category labels.\n",
    "   - More memory-efficient, especially with many repeated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operations**:\n",
    "   - Limited string operations compared to `str`.\n",
    "   - Faster for operations involving large datasets with repeating categories due to the use of integer codes.\n",
    "   - Supports category-specific operations like reordering, adding, or removing categories.\n",
